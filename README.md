# Lenssion
Lenssion is combining ERC-6551 (Token Bound Accounts) and ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) and many more to give NFTs their own, separate history.

For example, NFTs having their own wallets unlocks use cases in gaming where characters would collect weapons, armors, loot during their lives and the owner of the character NFT would easily trade all of the inventory associated with the character.

Built during EthGlobal Lisbon 2023
